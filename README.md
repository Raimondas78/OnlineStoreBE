# OnlineStoreBE

## This is repo for BE files of Online Store Project

This project is being build on Java 8. In order to make it running you need to MySql database, 
where need to create a schema 'onlinestore'. Flyway migrations 
will create two tables for now, and most important from them is category table.
The test data will be input by migrations, so you can test it.
In application.properties file need to input your own
database user and password, as in this file you will find asterisks instead of actual values.
Run this app by running OnlineStoreApplication class.
